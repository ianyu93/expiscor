## Ian Yu - Pragmatic AI Engineer in Toronto
My work is best described as an AI Engineer, currently working at Pixomondo with a few side gigs.

I really enjoy AI Engineering, but not from web development perspective. I focus on building a system that adheres both to ML best practices and user experiences. I love projects that facilitate human intelligence; the peak of AI is to enable humans to do the impossible things.
